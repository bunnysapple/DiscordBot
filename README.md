# Discord Bot

This is a free template for a discord bot which only does small thigns like reply to "!hello" and when someone is added to a server and leaves.

I made this as a distraction from web development and to learn and get comfortable with python before I start my back end journey using python.

I do not think I will be updating this any more, but that remains to be seen.
